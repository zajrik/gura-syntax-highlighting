# Gura Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides syntax highlighting for the [Gura configuration format](https://gura.netlify.app/).

Additionally, language configuration is provided to allow applying comments to the current line/selection
via the `ctrl + /` keyboard shortcut, as well as auto-closing of quotes, square braces, and auto-indenting
when pressing `enter` after top-level key or object key.
